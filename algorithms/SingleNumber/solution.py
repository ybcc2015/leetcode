@Description:

    Given a non-emptyÂ array of integers, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.
    Note: Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?

    Example 1:
        Input: [2,2,1]
        Output: 1

    Example 2:
        Input: [4,1,2,1,2]
        Output: 4
