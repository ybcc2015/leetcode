@Description:

    Given a non-emptyÂ array of integers, every element appears three times except for one, which appears exactly once.
    Find that single one.
    Note: Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?

    Example 1:
        Input: [2,2,3,2]
        Output: 3
    Example 2:
        Input: [0,1,0,1,0,1,99]
        Output: 99
