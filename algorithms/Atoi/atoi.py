@Description:

    Implement atoi which converts a string to an integer.

    Example 1:
        Input: "42"
        Output: 42

    Example 2:
        Input: "   -42"
        Output: -42
        Explanation: The first non-whitespace character is '-', which is the minus sign.
                    Then take as many numerical digits as possible, which gets 42.

    Example 3:
        Input: "4193 with words"
        Output: 4193
        Explanation: Conversion stops at digit '3' as the next character is not a numerical digit.

    Example 4:
        Input: "words and 987"
        Output: 0
        Explanation: The first non-whitespace character is 'w', which is not a numerical
                     digit or a +/- sign. Therefore no valid conversion could be performed.

    Example 5:
        Input: "-91283472332"
        Output: -2147483648
        Explanation: The number "-91283472332" is out of the range of a 32-bit signed integer.
                     Therefore INT_MIN (âˆ’2^31) is returned.
